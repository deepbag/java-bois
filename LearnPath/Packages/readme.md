A package is a namespace that mainly contains classes and interfaces. For instance, the standard class ArrayList is in the package java.util. For this class, java.util.ArrayList is called its fully qualified name because this syntax has no ambiguity. Classes in different packages can have the same name. For example, you have the two classes java.util.Date and java.sql.Date, which are different. If no package is declared in a class, its package is the default package.

To create package use this command -> javac -d directory javafilename

n Java, a package is a way to organize related classes and interfaces into a single namespace. A package can contain other packages, as well as classes and interfaces, and can be used to avoid naming conflicts, make it easier to manage large projects, and provide better access control.

Java provides a number of built-in packages, such as java.lang, java.util, and java.io, which contain many commonly used classes and interfaces. Additionally, developers can create their own packages to organize their own classes and interfaces.

To define a package in Java, we use the package keyword followed by the package name, which should be a unique name that reflects the purpose or domain of the classes and interfaces in the package. The package declaration should be the first statement in the source file, before any import statements or class definitions.

package com.example.myapp;

public class MyClass {
    // class code here
}
