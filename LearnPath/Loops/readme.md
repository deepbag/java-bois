In Java, a loop is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition. There are three types of loops in Java: for, while, and do-while.

for loop:
The for loop allows you to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times. It has three parts: initialization, condition, and update.

for (initialization; condition; update) {
// code to be repeated
}

while loop:
The while loop allows you to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is true. It has only one part: the condition.

while (condition) {s
// code to be repeated
}

do-while loop:
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it executes the block of code at least once, even if the condition is false. It has two parts: the block of code, and the condition.

do {
// code to be repeated
} while (condition);
