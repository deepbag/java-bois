Java has two categories of data types: primitive data types and reference data types.

Primitive data types: These are the most basic data types in Java and are used to store simple values. There are eight primitive data types in Java:

byte: A 1-byte integer value, ranging from -128 to 127.
short: A 2-byte integer value, ranging from -32,768 to 32,767.
int: A 4-byte integer value, ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
long: An 8-byte integer value, ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
float: A 4-byte floating-point value, ranging from 1.4E-45 to 3.4E+38.
double: An 8-byte floating-point value, ranging from 4.9E-324 to 1.8E+308.
boolean: A value that can be either true or false.
char: A 2-byte Unicode character, ranging from '\u0000' to '\uffff'.
Reference data types: These are used to store the reference or memory address of an object, rather than the value of the object itself. There are three reference data types in Java:

Class: A class type, representing a class definition in Java.
Interface: An interface type, representing an interface definition in Java.
Array: An array type, representing an ordered collection of elements of a specific data type.
