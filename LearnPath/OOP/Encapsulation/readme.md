Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the practice of hiding the internal workings of an object and providing a well-defined interface through which other objects can interact with it. It is one of the four pillars of OOP, along with abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

In Java, encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers like private, public, and protected. These access modifiers determine the level of visibility of variables and methods of a class. By marking variables as private and methods as public or protected, we can restrict direct access to the variables and methods from outside the class, and instead provide a controlled way of accessing and modifying the variables through the methods.

Encapsulation provides several benefits, including:

Security: By restricting direct access to variables and methods, we can prevent unauthorized access and modification of the object's state.

Abstraction: Encapsulation provides a clear separation between the interface and implementation of an object, allowing us to modify the implementation details without affecting the external interface.

Flexibility: Encapsulation allows us to change the implementation details of an object without affecting the rest of the code that uses it, making it easier to maintain and extend the code.
