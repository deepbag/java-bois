In Java, an interface is a collection of abstract methods that can be implemented by any class. An interface can be thought of as a contract between two parties: the interface and the class that implements it. The interface specifies what methods must be implemented by the class, but it does not provide any implementation for those methods. Instead, the implementation is left up to the class that implements the interface.

To create an interface in Java, you use the interface keyword.
