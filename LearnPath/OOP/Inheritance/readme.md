Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to define a new class based on an existing class. The new class inherits the properties and methods of the existing class, and can also add new properties and methods of its own.

In Java, inheritance is implemented using the extends keyword. When you define a new class that extends an existing class, you are creating a subclass of the existing class. The existing class is known as the superclass or parent class.
