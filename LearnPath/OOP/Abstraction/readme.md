Abstraction in Java refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary and relevant information to the user. It is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) and helps to create more maintainable and flexible code.

In Java, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used as a base class for other classes. It may contain both abstract and non-abstract methods. Abstract methods are declared but not implemented in the abstract class, and their implementation is provided by the subclasses that extend the abstract class.

On the other hand, an interface is a collection of abstract methods and constants that define a contract that a class must follow if it implements the interface. Interfaces are used to achieve multiple inheritances and provide a way for unrelated classes to work together through a common set of methods.

By using abstraction, we can separate the concerns of a program and reduce the complexity of the code. It also makes it easier to modify and extend the code without affecting the existing functionality.
