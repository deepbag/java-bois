Here are some basic syntax rules in Java:

Java code is written in a text editor and saved with the ".java" file extension.
Each line of Java code should end with a semicolon (;) to indicate the end of the statement.
Java is case-sensitive, so the capitalization of letters matters.
Java code is organized into classes, which are containers for related methods and variables.
Each Java program must have a main method, which is the entry point for the program.
Comments can be added to Java code using the "//" symbol for single-line comments or "/\* \*/" for multi-line comments.
Java variables must be declared with a data type, such as int or String, before they can be used.
Java has a set of reserved keywords, such as public, class, static, and void, that have special meanings in the language and cannot be used as variable or method names.
