In Java, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused multiple times in a program. Functions are also known as methods in Java. Here's the syntax for defining a function in Java:

accessSpecifier returnType functionName(parameterList) {
// Function body
}

In Java, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be reused multiple times in a program. Functions are also known as methods in Java. Here's the syntax for defining a function in Java:

accessSpecifier returnType functionName(parameterList) {
// Function body
}
Let's break down each part of the function definition:

accessSpecifier: This specifies the visibility of the function, i.e., where the function can be accessed from. It can be one of four access specifiers: public, private, protected, or no specifier, which means the function is accessible within the same package.
returnType: This specifies the type of value that the function returns. It can be any valid data type in Java or void, which means the function doesn't return any value.
functionName: This is the name of the function. It should be a valid identifier, following the same rules as variable names.
parameterList: This is a list of parameters that the function accepts. Each parameter consists of a data type and a name, separated by a comma. If the function doesn't accept any parameters, the parameter list can be empty.
