<!--  A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes,
 where each node stores a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node
 in the list. The first node is called the head, and the last node is called
 the tail. If a node does not have a reference to the next node, it is considered the tail. -->

<!-- class Node {
     int data;
     Node next;

     public Node(int data) {
     this.data = data;
     this.next = null;
     }
     }

     Node head = new Node(1);
     head.next = new Node(2);
     head.next.next = new Node(3);

     To traverse a linked list, you can start at the head node and follow the
     next references until you reach the end of the list. For example:

     Node current = head;
     while (current != null) {
     System.out.println(current.data);
     current = current.next;
     } -->
